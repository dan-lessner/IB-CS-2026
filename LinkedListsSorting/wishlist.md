# What we want from HL students:

* len function for lists - done in len() by Honza
* is_empty function for lists - done in len() by Honza
* list reversal - done in reverse() by Kuba
* removing a value (as opposed to a node)
* concatenation

# What we want from everyone:

Choose a sorting algorithm which could be interesting on linked list. Implement it. Analyze it.

The difference probably will not be in comparisons, but possibly in swaps or lookups.
